<h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>

<h2>definition</h2>
<p style="color:white;">It is the simulation of human intelligence in machines to do tasks that include 
gathering information, reasoning and correction. Involves the use of neural 
networks and programming. 
To make an AI project it must learn how to act in each project by:</p>

<h2>Neural Networks</h2>
<img src="Capture.PNG" width="504" height="242">
<p style="color:white;">A network of nodes created to resemble the human brain loosely. It includes 
multiple layers of interconnected nodes where each nodeâ€™s output depends 
on the values of the nodes connected to it and the weights of the 
connections. The networks learn to do specific tasks through continuous 
example and trial and error through a process called gradient descent.</p>

<td> Reactive machines are the simplest level of robot. They cannot create memories or use information learnt to influence future decisions </td>
<td> Limited Memory is able to retain some information learned from observing previous events or data. </td>
<td> Human beings have thoughts and feelings, memories or other brain patterns that drive and influence their behaviour </td>
<td> Self-awareness AI machines are the most complex that we might ever be able to envision and are described by some as the ultimate goal of AI. </td>
