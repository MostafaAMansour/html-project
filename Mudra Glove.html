<h1>Mudra Golve</h1>
<img src="download.jfif" width="504" height="442">
<p>Mudra glove is a new innovative device designed and developed by an Indian student. The glove translates the commonly used gestures and hand 
signs directly to voice to ease the communication process for mute people and allow them to run full conversations with normal people without going 
through the pain of having to find way that work for both parties to convey their thoughts and ideas or tell their needs. The glove can be worn like any 
other riding glove and won’t cause a problem for its users throughout the day. The glove recognizes all kinds of hand gestures and signs in all possible 
directions and angles, using flex resistors, accelerometers and gyroscopes. The output of the glove is processed through the built-in algorithm 
connected to the glove that’s wirelessly connected to a mobile phone and then the speech is spoken out through the 
speakers. The solution also gives various options to the users like the ability to 
process the signs as text and use that text in conversations or the ability option to show 
it as it is for educational purposes on computer or smart phone. The application 
is specifically designed so it doesn’t impose any challenge when wearing it and so it 
feels easy for the user to deal with.</p>
