<h1>P3 mobile</h1>
<img src="screen-6.jpg" width="504" height="242">
<p style="color:white;">P3 mobile is a mobile application designed specifically for deaf people and is available through all mobile platforms like 
android google play and IOS’s iTunes. P3 Mobile is the on-the-go VRS (Video Relay Service) app that makes it easy for 
deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to make and receive VP calls anywhere using a Wi-Fi or a cellular data connection. 
The application is specifically designed for those who can’t hear and speak and instead of being a normal application that 
will just convey the video to the other party, the application is implemented with a recognition system that interprets the 
sign language of those people which is the main method used in communication between them. The application offers a 
variety of methods to achieve the communication between the two parties like using an implemented text service or 
running a video call using each one’s mobile camera to keep a practical running conversation. 
As shown in fig the conversation will run smoothly with the two or more involved parties seeing each other and able to convey what they want to say 
readily.</p>
