<h1>Signing Savy</h1>
<img src="fingerspelling.jpg">
<p>Signing savy is a mobile application designed for deaf and mute people to teach them sign language to 
allow them to communicate effectively with each other and with other people who know sign language. 
The application also tries to target people who doesn’t have any of those disabilities to raise 
awareness of the importance of having people who can communicate with those people to understand 
their needs and to make them feel like everyone else, not as if they’re left out and have something that 
prevents them from participating effectively in their surroundings and interact with people. Signing Savvy 
is a finished gesture-based communication asset that incorporates a gesture-based communication lexicon 
containing a few thousand high-goals recordings of American Sign Language (ASL) signs, finger spelled 
words, and other basic signs utilized inside the United States and Canada. Signing Savvy likewise 
incorporates a large group of assets and instruments to utilize while learning gesture-based 
communication. The application depends mainly on wide libraries used to extract sign language gestures and implement them in 
the process of teaching people how to use them. The application is also full of tutorials on how to deal with the application and gives 
its users the ability to make video calls with others who also seek to learn that language and connects them together in an environment that pushes 
them to learn faster and in a friendly manner. </p>
